It could have been a worst-case scenario for 
Rocky Mountain National Park: a “Land for Sale”
sign going up on the largest privately-held,
developed parcel in the Wild Basin area. 
If not for a quick response from the 
Rocky Mountain Conservancy, a 12.5-acre 
property would have been listed for public 
sale for only the second time in 70 years. 
Learn more about this property that was purchased
for the park on December 14.
