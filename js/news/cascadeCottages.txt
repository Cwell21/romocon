Cascade Cottages, the largest remaining privately 
held parcel of land within the boundaries of Rocky 
Mountain National Park, was recently acquired through 
the generosity of Conservancy donors. Soon the property
will be transferred to the park. With your continued 
support, the Conservancy will play a major role 
assisting the park to determine the best use of these
facilities. Please help us in this essential planning 
and restoration phase of the project.
